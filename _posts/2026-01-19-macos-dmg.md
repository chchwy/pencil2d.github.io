## Pencil2D Now Available as a DMG

Good News for macOS Users. We’ve upgraded our macOS distribution from ZIP archives to the DMG (Disk Image) format—the standard, user-friendly installation method Mac users expect.

## Why the Change?

- **Easy Installation**:  Open the DMG and drag Pencil2D to your Applications folder. This familiar workflow integrates perfectly with macOS. No more manual unzipping or running the app from the Downloads folder.

- **Safe & Verified**: The DMG is signed with a trusted developer certificate. This means a goodbye to those "Unidentified Developer" warnings. When you open Pencil2D, macOS will recognize it as verified software from a known source.

## Get Started

Download the new DMG format from **[Nightly Builds Page]({{ "/download/nightly/" | relative_url }})**.

## We’d Love Your Feedback

Happy animating!
